About the dataset:
This database was created to identify a high quality or a low quality wine, based upon properties of the wine. The dataset consists of 12 properties of 6497 samples collected from the north of Portugal. Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brand, wine selling price, etc.). The data were collected from May/2004 to February/2007 using only protected designation of origin samples that were tested at the official certification entity (CVRVV).
